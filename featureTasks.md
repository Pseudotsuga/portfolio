Feature #1: Refactor the CSS
Why are we implementing this feature?
As a user, I want the portfolio to have a clean UI so that it is visually appealing.
What are we going to implement?
Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the user navigates to the home page
Then the portfolio contents should be displayed

How are we implementing it?
Refactor the main.css file using SMACSS principles.
You may decide how many files to include, but at the minimum should include base.css, layout.css, and modules.css. However, think through the way you separate your CSS rules. For example, you may want several CSS files in a modules folder, if you feel that the code needs to be organized in that manner.
